Arduino Robot that communicates with ROS wirelessly

This is my end of degree project. I made a cheap arduino robot (compared to other commercial robots) and used ros-arduino-bridge to communicate it with ROS.
It has a some sensors that uses to move through the environment avoiding obstacles and even create maps of the environment.

The paper where everything is explained can be found here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nih4irgnexa7ao0/memoria.pdf?dl=0">Paper (Spanish)</a>

The user manual where I explain how to build the robot and install the software is here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/r50zx74r2i9n900/Manual%20de%20usuario.pdf?dl=0">User Manual (Spanish)</a>
